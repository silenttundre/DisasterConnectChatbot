[FAQ:]
Why aren't there new updates on an incident?
We release any and all vetted intelligence within minutes after we receive it.  This information comes from either incident command over the radio scanner or official posts from sheriffs, fire departments, USFS, etc.  There are many times, especially on an extended incident, where information goes dark and radio chatter becomes quiet.
We understand this can be frustrating because it’s frustrating for us too.  We have over a hundred volunteers spending their days constantly listening, communicating directly with officials, and still coming up blank. We would like you to join us in urging our local officials to release more information to help keep everyone informed and calm our nerves during these incredibly difficult times.
Finally, although we never take information directly from the public, if you see posts from officials like sheriffs or fire departments on social media that you think we should be sharing with Watch Duty users please feel free to send the link our way. 

What do RV, PR, CS, NW, and CR mean?
These terms are specific to the Central Oregon Interagency Dispatch Center and represent the division the fire is in.
RV - Rivers
PR - Prairie
CS - Cascade
NW - Newberry
CR - Crescent

What are Silent Incidents?
Silent incidents are fires that we are monitoring but are not considered a threat to the entire community at this time. They are displayed on Watch Duty as a small bell with a line through it, indicating it is silent and we are currently monitoring.  
<image>silent_incident_bell.jpg</image>
If this incident becomes a threat to the larger community we will upgrade this incident and push notifications will be sent. 
 
Opt-in to receive notifications for silent incidents
If you would like to be notified of these incidents in your county can subscribe in the 'Notifications' section of the left hand menu.  There can set more fine grained controls and get notified of these smaller incidents early.

Why don’t I see my photo in Watch Duty?
The photos you submit are moderated by our reporters. We can’t include every photo we receive. Your photo might not have been reviewed by our reporters yet, or it might not be approved based on multiple factors, like whether we already have a similar photo.

Why don’t you report on the causes of fire?
Our primary objective is reporting on fire activity and not cause. This is so people can have fast and accurate information in case the fire will impact them. Fire causes are often picked up official law enforcement agencies (which includes CALFIRE) with information not available to the public until the investigation is completed. This could be days, months or even years after the event has concluded. We would recommend you contact the agency in charge for additional information on specific fire causes for events you are interested in.

Why don't you report every fire in my area?
Watch Duty focuses on high-risk vegetation fires and fires that have the potential to become high-risk vegetation fires.
We will typically not report on:
Structure fires unless they spread to the vegetation
Minor fires that are classified by arriving first responders as having slow or no rate of spread within a small area, not threatening structures, and are expected to be handled quickly.
We will sometimes post fires with negligible risk when there is obvious smoke visible over a large area or aerial resources are present that may be concerning to residents.

Who writes the updates in Watch Duty?
Contrary to popular belief we are not crowdsourced.  We have over 100 trained volunteers who are either active or retired first responders, dispatchers, paramedics, and reporters.  These men and women work together in real-time to assess the situation and send you updates as the incident unfolds.  Our training and Code of Conduct are extremely important in order to get fast and accurate real-time information to you safely.
 
You can read more about our reporters watchduty.org/reporters

Where do you get your information?
Our information comes from a myriad of sources that are all publicly available.  First and foremost we listen to live radio chatter between first responders, dispatch, etc.  This is where a lot of real-time intelligence comes from.  You will often see "per scanner traffic" in many of our updates which is referring to this type of information.
 
Just as important we are also watching for updates from local sheriffs, CALFIRE, USFS, etc via Nixle, Facebook, Twitter, and any other medium they are using.  It is important to note that you should always subscribe to your local counties updates as well as Watch Duty.   We do our best to consolidate all of this information in one place but you can never have enough information when it comes to disasters like wildfire.
 
We take the trust people put in us very seriously - we have a strict code of conduct that governs what kind of information we publish and how. Learn more about our code of conduct at watchduty.org/code-of-conduct

What is the Air Quality Index (AQI)?
The EPA and your State environmental agency measure pollution in the air and use the Air Quality Index, or AQI, to report how good or bad the air is.
Color dots go from Green to Yellow to Orange to Red to Purple to Maroon and number range from 0 to 500.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) mapping layer can be toggled on and off by tapping on the Layers button from the map and scrolling to the Weather section.
To turn on or off this layer, tap the Layers button and tap Air Quality Index.
<image>air_quality_index.jpg</image>
0-50: Air quality is satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk with 24 hours of exposure.
51-100: Air quality is acceptable. However, there may be a risk for some people with 24 hours of exposure, particularly those who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.
101-150: Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects with 24 hours of exposure. The general public is less likely to be affected.
151-200: Some members of the general public may experience health effects with 24 hours of exposure; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.
201-300: Health alert: The risk of health effects is increased for everyone with 24 hours of exposure.
301 and Higher: Higher Health warning of emergency conditions: everyone is more likely to be affected with 24 hours of exposure.


Why are some flame icons on the map gray?
All active fires have orange flames, and inactive fires have gray flames. We leave a fire active, even when forward progress is stopped. We inactivate it only once we hear the all clear, with units released.

What are the red dots on the map?
The red colored dots are the the latest hotspots detected by the VIIRS and MODIS heat-detection satellites. We do not have VIIRS and MODIS data for every fire. Where we do have data, this provides a good general sense for where the fire has been over the last 24 hours.

What are the red areas on the map?
The red-colored areas are the "Active Fire Perimeters", based on the official perimeters provided by CAL FIRE. You can turn these on and off with the layers button.

Why are the incident "flames" on the map sometimes different sizes?
The size of the flame icon reflects the acreage of the fire. This is only a rough guide, to indicate whether a fire is small, medium or large. For very large fires that have an official CALFIRE perimeter, we show the perimeter on the map as a red shaded area.

How long does a fire stay on the map after it's contained?
Fires that are marked 100% contained will stay on the map. Once all units are released the fire will be marked inactive. Inactive fires stay on the map for up to 48 hours before being removed.

Why am I under an evacuation status?
We relay evacuation information as it is issued by officials. Any questions regarding evacuation parameters should be directed to the responsible agency - usually the local law enforcement agency, but an Incident Management Team should be also able to assist with your question.

We only use official evacuation information and the source for our evacuation information is always listed in the update, and sometimes in the "Evacuation Notes" section of the relevant incident - such as an evacuation map if one is available. Stay safe.

Why is the fire perimeter missing?
Updated 1 month ago
We automatically source our perimeters from the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), FIRIS, and various other government sources so the issue is likely with their data; however, we will have one of our reporters and an engineer investigate this and see if we can mitigate the issue with the perimeter on our end.

Why is my current location not accurate?
When using a cellular phone, the accuracy of location services is dependent on how well your phone is receiving GPS signals. Depending on the type of phone you have and the construction of your home it may not work well indoors. It may work better near a window, or more certainly if you take your phone outside. It can take some time for each GPS satellite's signal to be recognized.
You may have also not given Watch Duty the ability to utilize a precise location, or location accuracy settings on your devices (android only) are not enabled, which can cause your location on the map to be off by a large margin.
Below are some resources that may help. The titles of these resources aren't fully descriptive, so please look through the links that are relevant to the type of phone you have.

How do I submit photos of fires to Watch Duty?
To submit photos of active fires and other hazards you must use the iPhone or Android Watch Duty app and take the photo in the app -- you cannot submit photos from your photo gallery.
Only take photos when you can do so from a safe location, without getting in the way of firefighters and other first responders. 
On the top right of your app tap the Camera button.
Type in a description of what you’re looking at and the location. Keep the description short, just the key information.
Press Submit when you’re done.
Your photo will now be reviewed by our reporters, who will decide whether to post it along with the incident.  We only post photos that help others see hazards and get a unique perspective on the situation.  

Can I use Watch Duty if I don't have a smart phone?
You can use access the Watch Duty application from any web browser at app.watchduty.org.
NOTE: You will not receive notifications for new fires or updates in your web browser. All the fire information is the same as in the app.
